					<span>Now the New-Year nighs, and the night passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dáy treads on dark, as deems the Almighty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But weathers full wild in the world awaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clouds strike keenly the cold to the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With enough of the North the nakèd to teen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The snow shower’d snell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-158" id="noteref-158" epub:type="noteref">158</a> and snapèd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-159" id="noteref-159" epub:type="noteref">159</a> the wild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whistling wind from the welkin smote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drove each dale full of drifts very deep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oft listen’d the leal man that lay in his bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he lock’d his lids, but little he slept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by each cock that crew he knew well his hour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full early was he up, ere ány day dawn’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there was light from a lamp that leam’d in his chamber;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He call’d to his chamberlain (and the call he answer’d),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade bring his byrnie and saddle his bay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then his man is afoot and fetches his weeds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And graithes me Sir Gawain in a great fashion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First he clad him in clothes the cold for to temper,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And eke in his harness that he had housèd with care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both his pounce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-160" id="noteref-160" epub:type="noteref">160</a> and his plates, polisht full clean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rings of his rich mail, scour’d of all rust;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All was fresh as at first, and fain was he then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">to speed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He had on him each piece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Well wiped, from foulness free’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Gayest from here to Greece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Gawain bade bring his steed.</span>

					<span>So Gawain arrays him in raiment full rich⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His coat, with the cognisance of clear devices</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Work’d upon velvet, virtuous stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Set about by the border, embroider’d seams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lined full fairly with furs of the finest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he left not the lace, the lady’s guerdon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Gawain forgat not for good of his soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had belted his brand on his broad haunches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then dress’d he his druery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-161" id="noteref-161" epub:type="noteref">161</a> double about him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wound round his waist that winsome lace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The girdle of green that gaily beseem’d him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the royal red so rich in semblance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not for its wealth did the wight wear it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the pride of the pendants, though polisht they were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though the glittering gold gleam’d at the ends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to save his dear soul, when to suffer behoved⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bide bale without brand or blade to defend him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">at all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Bold man! his hour is due,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He passes from the hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Praises that meiny true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And often thanks withal.</span>

					<span>Then was Gringolet graith, a great horse and noble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had been lodg’d to his liking, and lustily fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him list prick for point,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-162" id="noteref-162" epub:type="noteref">162</a> that proud horse then.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gawain to him goes, and gazes on his coat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And says to himself (and swears by his sooth)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“There is a meiny in this moat, that of courtesy minds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man that maintains them, máy he have joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady, long live she, and love her betide!</span>

					<span>That upholds the heaven, and also you all!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if life I may lead so long upon earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some guerdon I shall give you, right gladly anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he steps into stirrup, and strides aloft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They show him his shield, and on shoulder he girds it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sets goad to Gringolet with his gilded heels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who starts on the stones, and stands there no longer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">to prance.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>On both hands unbarr’d, and borne wide open;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he blessèd himself and the board rode over.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He prais’d the porter, (who kneel’d to the prince,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Giving him “Good-day,” and “God save Gawain”)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then went on his way with the wight alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That should guide him i’ the gate to the gloomy place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where behoved him endure the doleful onset.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They rode by banks where boughs were bare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They clomb by cliffs where the cóld clùng;</span>

					<span>High were the clouds, but ’twas ugly thereunder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It mizzled on the moor, on the mountains it pour’d⁠—</span>

					<span>Each hill had a hat and a hood of vapour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brooks boil’d and broke as their banks they swept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shatter’d on shores where adown they shot.</span>

					<span>Oh! wildsome was the way where by wood they should ride,</span>

					<span>Wones a wight in that waste, the worst upon earth,</span>

					<span>Then his bridle he tugg’d, and homeward he turn’d,</span>

					<span>Rough-knuckled knars with gnarlèd stones,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But on no síde could it see, and strange he thought it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon, a little on a laund, a low as it were,</span>

					<span>A barrow by a bank at the búrn sìde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fast by a fall of that foaming water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein bubbled the burn, as if it had boil’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He urges his horse and hies to the knoll</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lightly by a linden leaps down and ties</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rein of his rouncy to a ruggèd branch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he bouns to the barrow and about it he strides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Busily debating what thing it might be;</span>
