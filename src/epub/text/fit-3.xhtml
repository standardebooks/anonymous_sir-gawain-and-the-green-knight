					<span>Full early before day the folks were afoot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Guests that would go, their grooms they summon’d,</span>

					<span>Who hied them in haste the horses to saddle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gather’d the gear and girded the mails;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-100" id="noteref-100" epub:type="noteref">100</a></span>

					<span>Those of rank were ready to ride all array’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leapt up lightly, and lay to their bridles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each wight on his way, where it well liked them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dear lord of the land was not last either,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Array’d for the riding, with retinue gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A morsel he ate, when his mass he had heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with bugle to bentfield he busk’d him anon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as any daylight dawn’d upon earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He and his athels on horse were mounted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then lads of that craft coupled their hounds,</span>

					<span>Unclosèd the kennels and call’d them thereout,</span>

					<span>So this lord is laiking by linden-wood eaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good man, Gawain, in gay bed sleeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lies snug till any gleam glimmers on wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under coverlet clean, curtain’d about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on slumber he slid, a sly noise heard he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little din at his door, which daintily open’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He heav’d up his head out of the clothes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A corner of the curtain he caught up a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And watched full warily what it might be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas the lady herself, lovely to look on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who drew the door after, so stealthy and still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And boun’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-108" id="noteref-108" epub:type="noteref">108</a> toward the bed; and he blush’d and shamed him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slipt him down slyly, and look’d as if sleeping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stept she stilly, and stole to the bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast up the curtain, and creeping within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat her full softly on the béd-sìde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And waited a while to watch when he waken’d.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long time did Gawain lie there lurking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast in his conscience what such a case</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might mean or amount to: marvel him thought it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he said to himself more seemly it were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By speech or by spell to aspy her intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he waken’d, and wroth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-109" id="noteref-109" epub:type="noteref">109</a> him, and toward her turn’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And opening his eye-lids with an air of surprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his safety him sain’d, and in secret a prayer</span>

					<span>“Fair gain!” said the goodman, “gramercy therefor;</span>

					<span>The huntsman halloo’d the hounds that gave tongue,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Is so uncouth to catch the manners of company,</span>

					<span>Where countenance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a> is clear, quickly to claim;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So becomes ev’ry knight that courtesy uses.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now spare me,” quoth Gawain, “such speech any more;</span>

					<span>Show’d them the shields, and shaped them the tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How large and how long that boar was of limb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how fiercely he fought when he fled to the wood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The knight full comely commended the deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the prowess prais’d that the lord had proved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such a brawn of a beast, the blithe man said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or such sides of a swine had he seen ne’er before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they handled the huge head, full high was his praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet the horror that he had, he utter’d no less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, Gawain,” said the goodman, “this game is your own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the covenant clear we accorded together.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That is sooth,” the knight said, “and as surely, i’ faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall I give you again all my gets in return.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then clasp’d he his neck and courteously kiss’d him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And served him eft-soons with a second kiss after.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We are even,” quoth the athel, “this ev’ning once more</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>As he sprang o’er a spinney the shrew to espy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he heard the hounds that hustled him on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reynard came running through a ruggèd clough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the rabble in a race right at his heels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wight was ware of him, and warily bode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drew a bright brand, and drove at the beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who swerv’d from the sword and away would have swung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But a hound was át him or ever he might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And before the foal’s feet the pack on him fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worried me that wily with a wróth clàmour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then alighted the lord, and leaping to seize him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rescued poor Reynard from ravening jaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And held him o’erhead, hollo’ing loudly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the barking pack full bravely him bay’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The huntsmen hied them with horns a many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sounding recall till they sighted the quarry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as were come that company noble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that bugle e’er bore, blew them together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the others hollo’ed that no hórns hàd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas the merriest music that man ever heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rich dirge that was rais’d for Reynard his soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">All’s done!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Hunters their hounds reward</span>

					<span class="i8">Fawning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a> their heads, each one;</span>

					<span class="i8">And strip his coat anon.</span>

					<span>Then hied they homeward, for even was come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sounding bigly on their bugle horns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the lord at last is alighted at home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finds fire upon floor, and the fair knight beside it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Gawain the good, who glad was withal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had delight of his love those ladies among;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wore a blue mantle was meet to the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a surcoat full seemly with soft fur lined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his hood of the same hung on his shoulder;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Border’d were both with ermine about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He meets me his man amidst of the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All gamesome he greets him and graciously speaks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am first to fulfil our forewards to-day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That we spoke, good speed, when we spared not of drink.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then accolls<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a> he that knight and kisses him thrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soundly and with semblance as sober as he might.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By heaven!” said the other, “ye had happy reward</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In winning of your gains, if ye gave but as good.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nay, the price!” quoth the prince, “what profits to ask?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have paid you complete the purchase I owed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marry,” said the merry man, “mine is a poorer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For áll day I hunted and Í have nought gotten</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this fox-skin foul, the fiend have the goods!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is far too poor to pay for the purchase<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye press on me here, the precious three kisses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">so good.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">“Enough,” quoth Sir Gawain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">“I thank you, by the rood:”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And how the fox was slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He told him, as they stood.</span>

					<span>With mirth and with minstrelsy, with meats at their will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They made as merry as any men might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save they were doting mad or drunk had been else;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What with laughing of ladies and lightsome jest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gawain and the goodman, full glad were they both.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the meiny also many japes made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till was come the season when sever they must,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to busk them to bed behoved them at last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then lowly his leave of the lord took Gawain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goodly him greeted and graciously thank’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“For the happy sojourn I have had in this hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the honour of the high feast, the High King reward you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I make me your man, to your mind if it be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For needs múst, as ye know, I move on the morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the promis’d squire ye shall send to escort me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the Green Chapel, as God will me suffer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dree on that day the doom of my weird.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In God’s name,” said the goodman, “with a góod wìll</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall I áll perform, that ever I offer’d.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then assigns he a servant to set him i’ the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And conduct him by the downs (lest dole him befal),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the forest track, where through frith he should fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">to show.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Gawain to thank was fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">For the kindness he would do;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Then of those ladies twain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He took his leave also.</span>

					<span>With kissings full sad he said his farewells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a húndred heártfelt thánks he had for them too;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those lovesome ladies the like return’d him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with careful sighings beken’d him to Christ.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He takes courteous leave of that kindly meiny;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each man that he met, he made him a thank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his seemly solace, and the boon service</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had been busy about him at his bidding to do:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each servitour there was as sorry to sever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they had wonèd for ay with the worshipful Gawain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then those lieges with light him led to his chamber</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brought to his bed, to be at his rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he slept there soundly, say it I dare not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had much on the morrow to mind, if he would,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">in thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Let him lie there at will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He is near the goal he sought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">If ye’ll a while be still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">I shall tell you how he wrought.</span>
