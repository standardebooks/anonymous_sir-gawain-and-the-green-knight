					<span>O happen’d this handsel to Arthur at Yule,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When for vaunting vows of adventure he yearned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though brave wórds had been wanting when they went to their meat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now are they bestead with stern work in plenty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To begin this game was Gawain full glad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the end be heavy, have ye no wonder:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For though men’s minds are merry, when mead they have ta’en,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A year swiftly yerns<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a> and yields ne’er the same⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>End and beginning agree not together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So this Yule over-pass’d and the year after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each season full soon ensued upon other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After Christmas came the crabbèd Lenten</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That tries us with fish, and fare more meagre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the weather of the world with winter it chides,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold shrinks adown,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-48" id="noteref-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a> clouds rise on high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shed the sheen rain in showers full warm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fall upon fair field; flowers peep forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grassland and grove green is their raiment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Birds busk them to build, and bravely they sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For solace of the summer that sues thereafter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">by way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And blossoms swell and blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">On hedgerows rich and gay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Then noble notes enow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">In holt are heard, in May.</span>

					<span>Comes the season of summer with its soft breezes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Zephyr soughs gently o’er seedling and grass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh! winsome is the wort on the wold that awakens</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bíde a blíssful glánce of the bright sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the dripping dew drops from the leafage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Autumn soon hies with his harder weather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And warns it ere winter to wax and be ripe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then drives he with drought the dust to arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it flies on high, from the face of the fold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wroth winds of the welkin wrestle with the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaves dart from linden and light to the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the grass grows gray that green was before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then all ripens and rots that rose up in springtime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus yerns the year in yesterdays many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And winter winds back, ’tis the world’s order,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">(Ah true!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Until Michelmas moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Is come, and winter’s due;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Then thinks Gawain full soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Of the ride that he must rue.</span>

					<span>Yet till All Hallows with Arthur he bode,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who made feast on that festival for his friend’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid revel full rich of the Round Table.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then courteous Knights and comely ladies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All for love of that liege were in longing and sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’er the less nor the latter they allow’d but mirth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though many were joyless, jesting the while.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After supper, full sadly he sought to his uncle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spoke of his passage in speech very plain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now, liege lord of my life, your leave I would ask;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye know all the case, and I care no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my trouble to talk, or to teen you one whit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I am bound for the buffet a bare night hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Green Knight must seek, as God will me speed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the best of the burg busk’d them together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ewain and Eric, and others full many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Dodinal the Dour, the Duke of Clarence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-49" id="noteref-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Launcelot, and Lionel, and Lucan the good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir Bors and Sir Bedivere, big men both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many another worthy, with Mador of the Port;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came all this company seeking the King,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With care at their heart, to counsel Sir Gawain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was dole very dree that day in the hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That so worthy as Gawain should wend on that errand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To endúre a gríevous dínt, and deal nevermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">with brand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">The Knight made ay good cheer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Said he, “Now grief is bann’d;</span>

					<span>When he was haspèd in arms, his harness was splendid,</span>

					<span>Then they show’d him the shield⁠—’twas of shéer gùles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the pentacle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-60" id="noteref-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a> painted in pure gold on it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the baldric he caught it and cast o’er his neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it became well the Knight, that comely armour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now why it should ’long to the leal Gawain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am intent to tell you, though my tale may linger;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis a sign that Solomon sometime appointed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be a tried token of truest fealty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ’tis a figure wherein there are five angles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the lines overlap and lock in each other</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without end, every way: and Englishmen call it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Everywhere, as I hear, the Endless Knot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this cause it became the good Kníght to wear it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in five ways faithful and five times five</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was Gawain known for good, and as gold refinèd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Void of all villainy, with virtues endued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">in moat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">So this pentangle new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">He bore on shield and coat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">As wight of word most true</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And gentlest knight of note.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-61" id="noteref-61" epub:type="noteref">61</a></span>

					<span>First he was found faultless in his fíve wìts,</span>

					<span>And his affiance on field was in the fíve woùnds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Christ got on Cross, as the creed tells us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whereso this man was in mellay bestead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His thought was on this, above all things else,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That his courage he caught from the five joys</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the high Queen of heaven had in her Child.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which cause the good Knight becomingly bore</span>

					<span>And pity, that passes all⁠—these pure five</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were more happ’d on this athel than on all other knights.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And these thews,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-65" id="noteref-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a> all five, were so throng upon him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They ran each into other, nor any end had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On five points fixt that failèd never,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along ev’ry line neither link’d nor sunder’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But everywhere endless, at each angle alike,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the game e’er began, or glode to an end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore on his sheen shield was shapen this knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Royally, with red gold upon réd gùles.</span>

					<span>So the folk at the court had their festive fare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both at mess and at meal-time men full doughty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Daintiest dishes dress’d on the dais.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ancient of eld at the end of the board,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the lord at her side, full seemlily sat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gawain and the gay burd, together they ate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Highest in honour, e’en as was meet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rest by rank, as the rule orders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were seated on settle and served at table.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was meat, there was mirth, there was measureless joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereof for to tell were trouble o’ermuch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though I pain’d me perchance to point you the tale;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet I guess that Gawain and the gay lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their company caught such comfort together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the dear dalliance of whisperèd words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In careless converse, courteous and chaste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That their play surpass’d any prince’s game,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">I trow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Some the loud trumpet wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Some on the shrill pipe blow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Each man his note did mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And they two theirs also.</span>

					<span>Much merriment made they that day and the morrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the third day as throng thereupon follow’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The jollity of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">St.</abbr> John’s day was joyous to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas the last of the laik, those lieges well knew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There were guests to go on the gray morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with wassail and wine they wake all that night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dance uncaring the courtly carols;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the last, full late their leave they have ta’en,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each wight that must wend on his way towards home.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gawain gives good-day to the goodman anon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he leads him to chamber, and the chimney beside</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Draws him adree<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-97" id="noteref-97" epub:type="noteref">97</a> and dearly him thanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the winsome worship that the wight had deign’d him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By honouring his house at the holy tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And adorning that place with his princely presence:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And so long as I live, I shall be the better</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since Gawain was my guest at God’s own feast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Gramercy, Sir,” said Gawain, “the gift is from you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the honour is my own, the High King reward you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore I plight me your pleasure to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I am beholden, in high and in low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">by right.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">The lord said he were fain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Longer to keep the Knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Then answer’d him Gawain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">By no way that he might.</span>

					<span>Then by courtesy craved he to know of Sir Gawain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What dréad deed had driv’n him at that déar tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the King and the court so keenly to seek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere the holidays wholly were hied out of town.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-98" id="noteref-98" epub:type="noteref">98</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Forsooth, sir,” he said, “ye say but the truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A high errand and a hasty has sped me from home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am summon’d, in sooth, to seek to a place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I wot not whither I must wend to find.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I might not miss it on New-Year’s morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the land in Logrès, so our Lord help me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore this point, sir, I put to you presently,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ye tell me with truth if ye tale ever heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Green Chapel, where on ground it stands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the Knight its keeper, that of colour is green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was stablisht a tryst by statute between us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I meet him at that mark, if I míght be alive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Néw-Year he named wants nów but a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I would look on that liege, if God would allow me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More gladly, by God’s son, than all góod upon earth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so, by your will, my way I must wend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have now but a bare three days to busy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as fain to fall fey as fail of mine errand.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the lord with a laugh, “Now lodge here behoves you⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall take you to your tryst by the term of the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Gréen Chapel on ground, let it grieve you no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall bide in your bed and be at your ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the first of the year ye shall fare on your way</span>

					<span>To your mark at mid-morn, to make what you like</span>

					<span class="i13">beside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Dwell here till New-Year’s day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">Rise and depart that tide,</span>

					<span>Then was Gawain full glad and gaily he laugh’d;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I thank you for this, before all other things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since my goal I have gain’d, I agree at your will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dwell here, and do what else ye may deem.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then drew him that sire to a seat at his side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let fetch the ladies to like them the better.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much jollity they enjoy’d, those gentles twain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the lord for his love spoke the leal man so fond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he wist not of his words, like a wight unwitted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then cried he aloud, as he call’d to the Knight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye have deem’d ye will do the deed that I bid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will ye promise keep at this present time?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By my troth, sir, yes,” said the trusty Gawain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“While I bide in your burg, I obey all your bidding.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since ye have travell’d,” quoth he, “and toil’d from afar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have wakèd me wíth, your wants are uncared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of sleep and of sustenance; soothly I know it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye shall lodge in your loft and lie at your ease</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tomorrow till mass, and to meat ye shall wend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When ye will, with my wife, who with you shall sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with company comfort, till to court I return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i13">Rest so;⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And I shall early rise,</span>

					<span class="i8">A-hunting will I go.”</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>“In God’s name,” said Gawain, “I grant it you fain;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Who brings us the beverage this bargain to seal?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the lord of the land; they laugh’d everyone,</span>
