					<span>When the siege and the assault were ceasèd at Troy,</span>

					<span>When the burg had been broken, and burnt to ashes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wight that the trains of treason there laid</span>

					<span>Was tried for his treachery, the truest on earth:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>

					<span>With many a lovesome lord, leal men of the best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the royal brethren of the Round Table,</span>

					<span>There true knights tourney’d, by times, full many,</span>

					<span>The year was yet young, ’twas the day of New Year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And double (as is due) on the dais was served;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the King with his knights had come into hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the chauntry in the chapel was chanted to an end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loud cry was uprais’d by common and clerk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who kept Noel anew and named it full oft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then hied in the courtiers handsel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> to offer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gaily cried Yule-gifts and gave them by hand,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And the winners were not wroth, well may ye trow.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And when they had wash’d, then went they to table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were rangèd by rank, as the rule is in hall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Queen Guenore full gay was graith’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> in the midst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the royal dais, royally array’d</span>

					<span>With sendal at the sides, and a ceiling above her,</span>

					<span>Tapestries full rich of the red Tars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>

					<span>But Arthur would not eat till all had been served,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was somewhat childgear’d,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> and gay of his youth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Life sat on him light, and the less he lovèd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either too long to lie or too long to sit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So busied him young blood, and his eager brain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And another mood moved him: for much did he love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All noble renown, and ne’er would he eat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At such a dear season till someone had told him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some story of chivalry, stirring and strange,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some main marvel, that he might believe in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of high knightérrantry, or other adventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or till someone besought him of a sickar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To join him in jousting and jeopardy of arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stake life for life, and each allow other</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fortune should favour advantage to have.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So custom’d the King, where court he e’er held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On each festive feast-day,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> with his free meiny</span>

					<span>Thus in stall did he stand, the stalwart Arthur,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lightly of trifles he talk’d at the table.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside Queen Guenore Sir Gawain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> was graith’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Agravain Hard-hand at her other side sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were nephews to the King, and knights full noble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bishop Baldwin was above, at the end of the board,</span>

					<span>And Urien’s son, Ewain, ate with his Grace.</span>

					<span>These were dight on the dais and daintily served,</span>

					<span>Many banners full bright a-hanging thereby:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The kettledrums next and the noble pipes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wild notes and shrill with their warbles awaken’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that every heart leapt high at their touches.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came dainties therewith and dishes full pleasant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fresh meats in plenty, on platters so many</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ’twas pain to find place, the people before,</span>

					<span>A close-fitting coat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> that clung on his body,</span>

					<span>A merry mantle over it, meetly adorn’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fair-trimmed fur, a lining full fine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of blythe ermine bright; and a hood with it bound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caught back from his locks and laid on his shoulders;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neat hose well-haul’d, of that hue all of green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That closed on his calf, and clean spurs under</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of oright gold, on silk bands, barrèd full richly,</span>
